So here are some of the ideas for our project

So we are doing Python Project and I'm suggesting some of the topics for our project
Some point to keep in mind while choosing our topic: We have to continue with the same topic in the mini project to the larger level in next semester so keeping that in mind. The Following Topics are:

1. Simple CUI Based Banking Application
2. Simple CUI Based Calculator
3. ROT-13 Algorithm Program (ROT-13 means adding the value 13 to the position of the alphabet. eg. 'A' becomes 'M')
4. Student Details Database

and if you want to suggest any other then please email me at:
